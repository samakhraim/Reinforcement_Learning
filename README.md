# Reinforcement Learning 

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for our final project on Reinforcement Learning. We have successfully completed the project, focusing on implementing the Q-Learning algorithm and conducting various training and testing phases to evaluate its performance.

## Project Overview

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that deals with decision-making in an environment. RL involves an underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP) and aims to derive an optimal policy for solving this MDP. In our project, we have implemented the Q-Learning algorithm, a model-free RL technique that learns the optimal policy directly through trial and error.

## Project Structure

The project was organized into several phases and included the following components:

**Q-Learning Code Implementation**: We successfully implemented the Q-Learning algorithm in Python. This code served as the foundation for training an RL agent to learn an optimal policy.

**Phase 1: Training and Observation**: During this phase, the RL agent underwent training using the Q-Learning algorithm. It interacted with the environment, updating Q-values based on observed rewards and actions. We analyzed the agent's learning progress and provided insights into its performance.

**Phase 2: Testing and Evaluation**: After training, the RL agent entered the testing phase. It interacted with the environment using the learned policy and collected data on its performance. We evaluated the agent's behavior and measured its success in accomplishing the task.

**Analysis and Comparison**: At the end of each phase, we provided a detailed analysis of the RL agent's performance. We compared the results obtained in different phases and discussed the improvements or challenges encountered during the learning process.

**Code and Results Organization**: To ensure clarity and ease of navigation, we organized the project's code and results effectively within the repository.
